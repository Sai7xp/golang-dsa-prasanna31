Collections in Java? They are super famous! As if people started thinking that building functions on data structures is redundant and we can just go use collections. That leverage is not currently available in Go and that made me come up with this golang-dsa.

This is a basic repo and it needs a lot of tweaks to make the scale higher, but I would say it works pretty well.

## Features

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Maps, Sets, Trees, Graphs, and Tries.
- **Algorithms**: Recursion, Searching, Sorting, Tree and Graph Algorithms, Greedy Algorithms, and Dynamic Programming.

## Installation

To install golang-dsa, run the following command:

```sh
go get github.com/prasanna31/golang-dsa
